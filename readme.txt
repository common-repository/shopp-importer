This version of the plugin is based largely upon Lee Tag's original Shopp Product Importer plugin. However, since he dropped support of the plugin and being in need to import over 5,000 products into my Shopp, I decided to take on this project to update the plugin with the help of Tim who updated the plugin originally.
